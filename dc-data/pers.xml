Lang married Martha Ladd in 1848, and they had several children. The papers of Isaiah S. and Martha Lang span the period 1858 to 1928 and consist of correspondence to Lang and his wife from various relatives and a small amount of business records. Approximately one-half of the correspondence is from Lang's maternal uncle, David M. Sanborn. All the Sanborn correspondence was written from Maryland locations, including Baltimore City, Marriottsville (Howard County), and Hanover (Howard County). In his letters, Sanborn calls himself an abolitionist, although he mentions his slave, Elize, several times. He also discusses economic and social conditions in Baltimore during the Civil War. Additional correspondents of the Isaiah and Martha Lang include relatives who moved to the frontier area of Minnesota: Ann Jane Campbell, A. E. Clay, Elizabeth Clay, James P. Clay and Ursula Stone. These letters contain economic and domestic information about frontier farming in Minnesota. A teacher friend, W. A. Worthen, of Laurel, Maryland also wrote several letters to Isaiah Lang describing his new life in the "South" and providing information about Lang's uncle, David M. Sanborn.

The papers of Isaiah S. and Martha Lang span the period 1858 to 1928 and consist of correspondence to Lang and his wife from various relatives and a small amount of business records. Approximately one-half of the correspondence is from Lang's maternal uncle, David M. Sanborn. All the Sanborn correspondence was written from Maryland locations, including Baltimore City, Marriottsville (Howard County), and Hanover (Howard County). In his letters, Sanborn calls himself an abolitionist, although he mentions his slave, Elize, several times. He also discusses economic and social conditions in Baltimore during the Civil War. Additional correspondents of the Isaiah and Martha Lang include relatives who moved to the frontier area of Minnesota: Ann Jane Campbell, A. E. Clay, Elizabeth Clay, James P. Clay and Ursula Stone. These letters contain economic and domestic information about frontier farming in Minnesota. A teacher friend, W. A. Worthen, of Laurel, Maryland also wrote several letters to Isaiah Lang describing his new life in the "South" and providing information about Lang's uncle, David M. Sanborn.

The letter discusses the situation prompting the writing of this letter and other domestic affairs of the day. She is feeling a little depressed because the day reminds her of her promise to an old friend that they would correspond every year on this day [February 19] and share what they did during the day, but her friend has recently passed away. Mention of the winter weather is also included detailing the inconveniences this causes to the people around her. Accompanying the letter was a Confederate flag, in which Margaret hopes May will "find comfort in the folds" of it. Baltimore County, Maryland, February 19 and 22, 1863.</description><rights>Collection may be protected under Title 17 of the U.S. Copyright Law.

John McConnell (June 24, 1825 - February 15, 1913) was a pastor in the Reformed Church in the United States, popularly known as the German Reformed Church. He served in the United States Army during the Mexican-American War and was in Mexico from about 1847 until 1849. As of 1859, he was serving as pastor to a congregation in Corydon, Indiana. A dispute in the church prompted McConnell to resign and to accept an offer from his friend, J. L. Swander, to serve two congregations near Salina, Pennsylvania. Leaving his wife Rachel and son [Yeakle Xenophon, born 1853] in Corydon, McConnell went to Pennsylvania. His assumption of the pastorate was complicated by the fact that a Mr. G. A. Albright was already leading one of the two congregations, though without the approval of the classis, the regional governing body of the German Reformed Church. The classis approved McConnell, not Albright, and McConnell served churches in Pennsylvania at least until the 1880s, though he maintained a farm in Corydon until selling the land in 1885. The John McConnell Collection consists of forty-nine letters written to John McConnell between October 1859 and August 1885 by a variety of correspondents, including his fellow ministers in the German Reformed Church and his brother George McConnell. Of particular interest are discussions of the organization of the German Reformed Church, relations of the German Reformed Church to other Christian denominations, problems in individual churches, and theological questions. George McConnell discussed many personal issues with his brother, including his wife Catharine's mental problems, his son John F.'s alcoholism, and his unhappiness at his son Elias's choice of a wife.

John McConnell (June 24, 1825 - February 15, 1913) was a pastor in the Reformed Church in the United States, popularly known as the German Reformed Church. He served in the United States Army during the Mexican-American War and was in Mexico from about 1847 until 1849. As of 1859, he was serving as pastor to a congregation in Corydon, Indiana. A dispute in the church prompted McConnell to resign and to accept an offer from his friend, J. L. Swander, to serve two congregations near Salina, Pennsylvania. Leaving his wife Rachel and son [Yeakle Xenophon, born 1853] in Corydon, McConnell went to Pennsylvania. His assumption of the pastorate was complicated by the fact that a Mr. G. A. Albright was already leading one of the two congregations, though without the approval of the classis, the regional governing body of the German Reformed Church. The classis approved McConnell, not Albright, and McConnell served churches in Pennsylvania at least until the 1880s, though he maintained a farm in Corydon until selling the land in 1885. The John McConnell Collection consists of forty-nine letters written to John McConnell between October 1859 and August 1885 by a variety of correspondents, including his fellow ministers in the German Reformed Church and his brother George McConnell. Of particular interest are discussions of the organization of the German Reformed Church, relations of the German Reformed Church to other Christian denominations, problems in individual churches, and theological questions. George McConnell discussed many personal issues with his brother, including his wife Catharine's mental problems, his son John F.'s alcoholism, and his unhappiness at his son Elias's choice of a wife.

Jewelry and silver items were left to her husband and his family members. Any children were to be wards of a cousin, John Kensett Kellogg. Thomas F. Balfe of Newburgh, New York, was named executor.

Using dramatizations, newsreel footage, family photos, and interviews with the 103-year-old Asayo - Obachan, or Grandmother, as her extended Canadian family calls her - this program traces one woman's tumultuous life story. From her early years in Japan, to her arrival in British Columbia as a mail-order bride, to her internment during World War II, to a reunion with a long-lost daughter, Obachan's remarkable personal story illustrates the Asian immigrant experience during the 20th century.</description><subject type="browse">Personal and Family Lives</subject><subject label="Films@UM" type="browse">Japan</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Japanese -- British Columbia -- Steveston</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Japanese -- British Columbia -- Steveston -- History -- 20th century</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Japanese -- Canada -- Evacuation and relocation, 1942-1945</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Mail order brides -- Japan</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Mail order brides -- British Columbia -- Steveston</subject><subject scheme="LCNAF" type="topical"><persName>Murakami, Asayo</persName></subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="genre">Documentary films</subject><identifier type="aleph">alephsys003136936</identifier><identifier type="oclc">ocm52926773</identifier><physDesc><extent units="minutes">95</extent><color>color</color></physDesc><relationships/><repository><corpName>Nonprint Media Services</corpName></repository><rights type="access">Access restricted to patrons at the University of Maryland.</rights></descMeta></str></doc>

She lived with her parents, William Eugene Biddle (b.ca.1797), a farmer, and Armina Nichols Biddle (b.1825) at "Hispaniolia". Hispaniolia was located near Chesapeake City and Elkton, Maryland, as noted on the postmarks on four envelopes included in the collection. M.T. was the eldest of at least six children, one of whom was a younger sister Isabell. She was a teacher and signed all the letters "Prof. M. T. Biddle." Maggie R. Thompson (b.1843), the recipient of the letters in this collection, lived in Nottingham and later Oxford, Pennsylvania. She refers to a younger sister, Ellie, and twin sisters in the letters. M.T. and Maggie attended school together, possibly the Oxford Female Seminary. Thompson was unmarried when the letters were written and M. T. Biddle addressed her as "Dr." Complete information may be found in the finding aid to the collection at: http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1432.</description><subject type="browse">Personal and Family Lives</subject><subject type="browse">Women's Studies</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical"><persName>Biddle, Marion Theresa, 1840-1869 -- Correspondence</persName></subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Maryland -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 -- Sources</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Thompson, Maggie R. -- Correspondence</subject><subject type="topical">Women -- Maryland -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Sources</subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="exact">1861-1870</decade></subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="exact">1851-1860</decade></subject><subject type="geographical"><geogName type="continent">North America</geogName><geogName type="country">United States of America</geogName><geogName type="region">Maryland</geogName></subject><physDesc><extent units="pages">33</extent><color>color</color></physDesc><relationships><relation label="archivalcollection" type="isPartOf"><bibRef><title type="main">Marion Theresa (M.

While at Point Lookout, Omenhausser documented prison life in sketchbooks with vibrant watercolors. His paintings were annotated with captions and dialog and, while intending to be humorous, often touch upon the grimmer aspects of camp life. Because he had relatives in the North, Omenhausser may have had an easier time obtaining supplies to make his life more bearable during that year. The University of Maryland Libraries owns one of only a handful of Omenhausser sketchbooks in existence, and our volume, with 62 color paintings, is the largest single collection.</description><rights>Collection may be protected under Title 17 of the U.S. Copyright Law.

Series I consists of ten letters sent from Herman Burhaus to one of his sisters. The letters are mainly personal, but often discuss aspects of military life in the Washington, D.C. area. One particularly informative letter discusses the Battle of Sharpsburg (Antietam) and the Battle of Harper's Ferry. On October 9, 1862, Burhaus wrote: "I think the battle of Sharpsburg would have decided this war only for the traitor in command of Harper's Ferry. Miles should have held the place to the last man and he could have done so untill [sic] McLellan reinforced him, and the rebel army in Maryland would have been captured or destroyed..."

Matilda Louisa Farquhar (known as "Tillie") was born January 14, 1841 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Her father, Edwin Yorke Farquhar, born circa 1808, and her mother, Anna Virginia Farquhar, born ca. 1805-1813, were both natives of Pennsylvania. Will Sterling was already in the Army when he married Tillie Farquhar. At the time of their marriage, through May 5, 1862, Will was "on recruiting service," probably in Philadelphia. From May 1862 until February 1863 he was stationed in Plattsburgh, New York, where he and Tillie lived. From February 1863 to February 1864, Will was stationed in Annapolis; for the last half of this period he was on mustering duty with the regiment there. Tillie again moved with Will, this time to Annapolis. The correspondence in this digital repository comes from this time period. While they were in Annapolis, on July 2, 1863, Will received his third promotion, to Captain. The letters are mainly accounts of day-to-day events combined with expressions of affection. Topics of discussion include military affairs (the mustering of troops, prisoners and prisoner exchanges, and changes in offers and duties), personal matters (lodgings, travel, entertaining), and subjects of general interest (slaves and slavery, secessionists, disease and vaccination, and unusual events).

Moved by familial concerns at the outbreak of the Civil War, Emory resigned his command on May 9, 1861, an action he immediately regretted. He tried to intercept the written dispatch of his resignation before it could be delivered, but failed in his efforts. The papers of William H. Emory cover the period 1861 to 1873 with the bulk of the material dating from 1861 when he was trying to remedy the problems connected with his hasty and much regretted resignation. The collection consists of letters to Emory from his wife, Matilda Bache Emory, and his brother, J. R. Emory, and manuscript copies of letters in Emory's behalf from General Winfield Scott and Lieutenant A. V. Colburn during the "resignation" period.

Matilda Louisa Farquhar (known as "Tillie") was born January 14, 1841 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Her father, Edwin Yorke Farquhar, born circa 1808, and her mother, Anna Virginia Farquhar, born ca. 1805-1813, were both natives of Pennsylvania. Will Sterling was already in the Army when he married Tillie Farquhar. At the time of their marriage, through May 5, 1862, Will was "on recruiting service," probably in Philadelphia. From May 1862 until February 1863 he was stationed in Plattsburgh, New York, where he and Tillie lived. From February 1863 to February 1864, Will was stationed in Annapolis; for the last half of this period he was on mustering duty with the regiment there. Tillie again moved with Will, this time to Annapolis. The correspondence in this digital repository comes from this time period. While they were in Annapolis, on July 2, 1863, Will received his third promotion, to Captain. The letters are mainly accounts of day-to-day events combined with expressions of affection. Topics of discussion include military affairs (the mustering of troops, prisoners and prisoner exchanges, and changes in offers and duties), personal matters (lodgings, travel, entertaining), and subjects of general interest (slaves and slavery, secessionists, disease and vaccination, and unusual events).

Moved by familial concerns at the outbreak of the Civil War, Emory resigned his command on May 9, 1861, an action he immediately regretted. He tried to intercept the written dispatch of his resignation before it could be delivered, but failed in his efforts. The papers of William H. Emory cover the period 1861 to 1873 with the bulk of the material dating from 1861 when he was trying to remedy the problems connected with his hasty and much regretted resignation. The collection consists of letters to Emory from his wife, Matilda Bache Emory, and his brother, J. R. Emory, and manuscript copies of letters in Emory's behalf from General Winfield Scott and Lieutenant A. V. Colburn during the "resignation" period.

Brooke -- From Deborah Hopkins with Elizabeth and Sarah Hopkins, 1825-1826. The materials in this collection document the everyday lives of members of the Brooke family of Sandy Spring, Maryland. Correspondents devote their attention to farm or city life, social events, Quaker religious concerns, courtship, vacations and travel, household duties, astronomy, and some business dealings. These letters are between the Hopkins sisters of Baltimore and the Brooke sisters of Sandy Spring. Deborah, Elizabeth, and Sarah Hopkins sent news and gossip to their cousins, Mary M.

Wye House appears on the National Register of Historic Places and is classified as a National Historic Landmark. Most of the recipes appear to be written in her hand, though some are different. Two signed recipes by Alicia Lloyd, daughter of Mary Lloyd, on page 77 are dated 1865 and 1868, respectively. A recipe signed by McBlair Lloyd, son of Mary Lloyd, and date June 30, 1878 is on page 98. A recipe for "My grandmother's Plum Pudding" on pages 30 and 31 is noted "Rec'd from Ireland 1844 Feb." One leaf containing pages 107 and 108 has been cut of of the book, and at least 16 pages are missing from the end, as well as the back cover and endpapers. Recipes written by Mary Lloyd are credited to: Mrs. Greenwood, Col France, Mrs. Eyre, Mrs. [Hinder?], Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Goodwin, Mrs. Pennington, Mrs. W. K. H., Sally [Lums?], Waverly, Mrs. Lynn, Mrs. H, Mrs. Goldsborough, Nannie Meier, and Petra May [?]. The recipes include soups, fish, meats, and baked goods.

The Lloyd family lived at Wye House near Easton in Talbot Count, Maryland. Wye House appears on the National Register of Historic Places and is classified as a National Historic Landmark. The creator of many of the recipes is unknown; they may have been written by Mary Lloyd, wife of Edward Lloyd VII, contemporary owner of Wye House, or added later by their descendants. A one page fragment appears to be part of the Lloyd-Tilghman family cookbook dated circa 1852-1880. An inscription on one side reads "Mary Lloyd, Presqu'ile, 1852." Presqu'ile is the French word for peninsula, and possibly refers to the location of Wye House on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Several recipes are written on stationary printed with addresses in Baltimore, Maryland. Recipes include six recipes for tea punch and one for champagne punch. One sheet lists nine recipes attributed to "Harriet (cook)", "Dar [Ellis or Ellie?]", "[Moses?]", and "Waverly". The sheet is labeled "Grandmother Lloyd" in different handwriting, and it is unclear who "Grandmother" refers to. The sources for the recipes are possibly slaves at the Wye House plantation. Other recipes attributed to: Miss Lizzie Lloyd (possibly Elizabeth Phoebe Lloyd, daughter of Mary and Edward Lloyd VII), Mrs. George Gibson, Mrs. Edgeworth Bird, Mrs. [Proome?], Mrs. John McF Bergland, Miss Mary C Stokes, Mrs. Bradley T. Johnson, [Carmen Jessica Johnson?], and Mrs. Ben Howard.</description><subject type="browse">Personal and Family Lives</subject><subject type="browse">Women's Studies</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Cookery</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Plantation life</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Housekeeping</subject><subject scheme="LCSH" type="topical">Alcoholic beverages</subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="circa">1851-1860</decade></subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="circa">1861-1870</decade></subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="circa">1871-1880</decade></subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="circa">1881-1890</decade></subject><subject type="temporal"><decade certainty="circa">1891-1900</decade></subject><physDesc><extent units="pages">33</extent><color>color</color></physDesc><relationships><relation label="archivalcollection" type="isPartOf"><bibRef><title type="main">The original cookbook was returned to the Lloyd-Tilghman family.

Upon retirement in 1876 he had attained the rank of brigadier general and had served in the Mexican War, the Civil War, and on the Indian frontier. The documents in the collection consist of a letterbook, a biography drawn up shortly before retirement, and some loose correspondence with his wife, Matilda Wilkins Bache Emory. Several of his letters center around a period of transition in the early 1860s when Emory was serving in Indian territory but preparing for removal to the East for service with the Union forces against the Confederacy.</description><subject type="topical">United States.

And, after Zug's death and Margaret Zug's remarriage sometime before 1846, there is extensive communication between Margaret and a cousin who moves from Pennsylvania to Richmond, Virginia, and reports her impressions of her new home and society.</description><subject type="topical">Dickinson College History Sources</subject><subject type="topical">Popular culture Moral and ethical aspects United States History Sources</subject><subject type="topical">Temperance United States History Sources</subject><physDesc><extent units="linear feet">1.50 (83 items)</extent></physDesc><repository><corpName>State of Maryland and Historical Collections</corpName></repository><subject type="browse">Personal and Family Lives</subject><subject type="browse">Women's Studies</subject><covPlace><geogName>not captured</geogName></covPlace><covTime><century era="ad">1801-1900</century><dateRange to="1851" from="1837" era="ad">1837-1851</dateRange></covTime><culture>not captured</culture></descMeta></str></doc>

Reuben Gilder married an Eliza Mary Hughes in Baltimore on February 17, 1819. According to Gilder's own accounts, he and his wife had at least one son, possibly named Columbus Franklin Gilder. Court records show that Reuben Gilder and his wife were granted a divorce on February 12, 1836. Gilder attempted a life in national politics, as evident from his application for the position of Doorkeeper (today Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper) of the U. S. Senate, which he failed to obtain. Gilder also suffered from various post-war ailments and health problems. The papers of Reuben Gilder consist of twenty-six letters written by Gilder to his former military comrade, Isaac Dutton Barnard, between 1815 and 1822. Subjects covered in the correspondence include: former military comrades, acquaintances, and experiences related to the War of 1812 in Canadian territory; military conflict with the Creek tribes of Native Americans; a variety of contemporaneous political matters and figures, including those in the local, national, and international arenas; and family, business, and health matters. Another, separate letter included in the papers was written by Reuben Gilder's wife, Eliza M. Gilder, in 1823. This letter is an urgent appeal to Isaac D. Barnard for his written recommendation for a military disability pension on behalf of her husband, Reuben Gilder. In a final, type-faced document of 1828, Reuben Gilder himself, Isaac D. Barnard, and the unknown individuals N. Towson and George Gibson all write on behalf of Reuben Gilder's ultimately unsuccessful quest to become Doorkeeper of the U. S. Senate.</description><subject type="topical">Soldiers Maryland Correspondence</subject><subject type="topical">Creek War, 1813-1814 History Archival resources</subject><subject type="topical">World politics History 19th century Archival resources</subject><subject type="topical">United States History War of 1812 Archival resources</subject><physDesc><extent units="linear feet">1 linear inch</extent></physDesc><repository><corpName>State of Maryland and Historical Collections</corpName></repository><subject type="browse">Personal and Family Lives</subject><subject type="browse">Women's Studies</subject><covPlace><geogName type="continent">North America</geogName><geogName type="country">United States of America</geogName><geogName type="region">Maryland</geogName></covPlace><covTime><century era="ad">1801-1900</century><dateRange to="1827" from="1815" era="ad">1815-1827</dateRange></covTime><culture>not captured</culture></descMeta></str></doc>

The BFL's purpose was to improve the lives and working conditions of all laborers through unionization and legislative action. In the early twentieth century the BFL agitated for issues such as the eight-hour work day, legalizing unions, eliminating child labor, and free, compulsory education. The organization still exists today as the Baltimore Council of AFL-CIO Unions. The Archives of the Baltimore Federation of Labor consist primarily of microfilmed minutes of meetings from 1918-1965, and other documents including a constitution, union publications, and two oral histories of Baltimore union members.

Both Fergusson and Hamilton were born in Scotland, but came to Maryland as young men and established themselves both as agents and as men of property. Fergusson owned Nanjemoy, an estate in Charles County, though he lived in Georgetown and later at "Mulberry Grove," also in Charles County, near Port Tobacco. Hamilton maintained a sizeable estate in Prince George's County, including more than ten slaves at the time of his death in 1799. The Fergusson/Hamilton papers date from 1761 to 1827, with the majority of documents dating from the 1780s and 1790s. The bulk of the papers consist of correspondence between Scottish firms such as Glassford &amp;amp; Company and their Maryland representatives Fergusson and Hamilton. Other documents include statements of debts incurred by planters and storekeepers with whom the agents dealt, records of the disposition of estates, and some agreements about the running of Fergusson's own estate. The collection also includes a number of legal writs from Worcestershire, England, and several drafted commentaries on a 1786 debate in the Maryland legislature on how to ease the post-Revolutionary War economic depression. The authorship and precise date of the political commentaries are unclear.</description><subject type="topical">Glassford and Company Correspondence</subject><subject type="topical">James Brown &amp;amp; Co.
